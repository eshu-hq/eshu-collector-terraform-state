This collector handles credential-bearing state. The test suite is the
product contract: `TestSourceURIRefusal`, `TestRedaction`, and the
`TestIsHardSensitive*` trio must stay green. Never weaken them to land a
change.

## Local checks

You need Go (see `go.mod`), `golangci-lint` v2.12.2, and Docker for the
image lane.

```sh
make ci   # lint + test + race, the whole local contract
```

`make lint` runs `go vet`, whole-repo `golangci-lint run` (config in
`.golangci.yml`, copied from `eshu-hq/.github@v1`; no baselines), the
gofumpt format check, `go mod tidy -diff`, and the 500-line cap on `.go`
files. `make race` also enforces the statement-coverage floor
(`COVERAGE_FLOOR`, starts at 80.7%, ratchets toward 90% and may only
rise).

## CI lanes

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs a `changes` job first, so a PR only pays
for lanes its paths can affect: Go sources run `lint`, `test`, `race`, `image` (the Dockerfile builds the binary from them);
fixtures and embedded config run `test`; shell scripts run `shell`;
`Dockerfile` and manifest changes run `image`; dependency changes run
`govulncheck`; workflow changes run `actionlint` plus the Go lanes.
`ci-complete` is the only required check: it fails when a needed lane
fails and passes when lanes were legitimately skipped (docs-only PRs).

Weekly, `govulncheck` and `gosec` (SARIF to the Security tab, advisory
until its false-positive rate is measured) run on a schedule and file an
issue on findings. Dependabot proposes weekly grouped `gomod` and
`github-actions` bumps.
